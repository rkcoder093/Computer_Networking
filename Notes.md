# OSI MODEL
 
**what is an networking modal?**
it provide the structure for the networking protocol and standards.

**Protocol -** a set of rules defined how network devices and software should work.

 # OSI MODEL 
 - open system interconnection model
 - conceputal model to communucate over the network.
 - created by ISO organization for Standardization.
 - divided into 7 layers.

1. Application
   - closest to end users=
   - indicates with software application like browsers.
   - HTTPS and HTTPS  are layer 7 protocols
   Functions.
   - identifying communication partners.
   - sync communications.
encapsulation - when the data is process throught the application layer to the physical layer the some part of data is added in that process is known as encapsulation.
the physical layer sent the dat to the destination and the destination recives the data and de-encapsulate it to get the data
de-encapsulate - the additional information is removed while moving to yhe top from physical layer to the application layer this is know as de-encapsulation.
2. Presentation
-  job for this layer to translate between application and network formats and vise versa. eg. encrypt the data when send and decrypt the dat when received.
3. Session
- controll sessions between the communication hosts.
- established manage and translate connections between the local application(my browser) and remote application(youtube).

**data is prepaired in top 3 layers (Application, presentation, and session) and then send to the bottoms layers.  when it reaches ti the transport layer the header is added to the data**

4. Transport
- segment and ressembles data for communication between host
